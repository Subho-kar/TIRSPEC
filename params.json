{"name":"Tirspec","tagline":"Codes to reduce TIRSPEC (TIFR Near Infrared Spectrometer and Imager) data.","body":"TIRSPEC\r\n=================\r\n\r\nContains the scripts which has to be used for the basic reduction of TIRSPEC data.\r\nAnd also some add-on scripts to assist during observation.\r\nCodes are mostly in Python.\r\n\r\nFeel free to modify as needed and use it while observing with TIRSPEC.\r\nMake sure, you keep the modified scripts under a seperate directory of your name, \r\nto prevent any conflict with default scripts for other users.\r\n\r\nYou may also find some helpful scripts in the following link: http://indiajoe.github.io/HandyTools4Astronomers/\r\n\r\nWebpage of this repository: http://indiajoe.github.io/TIRSPEC/\r\n\r\nContents\r\n================\r\n### Major Scripts: ###\r\n*    **Generate4mRamp.py**  *:* This script generates the slope calculation from up-the-ramp readout raw data. It produces the dark subtracted final slope images. A log file is also generated. You can load this also as a module in IPython, and use the collection of functions in it for an interative analysis of tirspec's raw data.\r\n*    **TIRSPECdataReduction.py** (needs **TIRSPECscript.conf**) *:* This script is to help the astronomer reduce tirspec data (output of *Generate4mRamp.py*) . It will semi-automate and guide the user through : *image selection, flat correction, aligning and combining of NIR dithered frames* for final photometry/spectroscopy.\r\n*    **AlignCombineImagesinDir.py** *:* This is a stand alone script to help astronomer align and combine his fits images.\r\n\r\n### Minor Scripts:  \r\nIntended for use on tirspec machine while observing.\r\n*    **StarPlot.py** (needs **StarPlot.gnuplot**) *:* This script is to quickly view the surface plot and contour of a star profile in fits file. \r\n*    **DitherAssistant.py** *:* To help in visualising Dither pattern and generating the commands to be given to Observatory Server.\r\n*    **TelescopeShift-4OS.py** *:* To get the input to be given to Observatory Server to move star to slit or any other location in image.\r\n*    **TelescopeShift.py** *:* To get the input to be given to Keystone Server to move star to slit or any other location in image.\r\n*    **lastNDR.sh** *:* To quickly load the last NDR readout frame of the directory to DV.\r\n*    **Start_TIRSPEC.sh** (needs **run_mkmac_h1_as.sh,run_dv_LampAlert.sh**) *:* This script starts TIRSPEC software for starting observation in the night.\r\n*    **.dv-init** *:* Some DV start up script to make life easier while observing.\r\n      \r\nModule Dependencies\r\n-------------------\r\nFirst few lines of the script will tell you the required python modules for each script.\r\nGeneraly speaking you will need: numpy, pyfits and pyraf\r\n      \r\n\r\nLicense\r\n---------\r\n\r\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
